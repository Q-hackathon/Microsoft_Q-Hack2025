# **Microsoft Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025**

## **Build AI Agents to Simplify Student Life**

### 📄 **Problem Statement**

Every year, thousands of students manage numerous tasks that can be time-consuming and challenging. With rapid advances in AI, you have the opportunity to design a group of AI agents that work together to simplify these tasks. 

In this challenge, you will develop multiple agents that collaborate to tackle various student-related problems. Your solution can address any aspect of student life, from academic management and scheduling to job applications and beyond.

The students are invited to focus on the issues that affect them the most. For example, you might build one agent that aggregates job listings and another that tailors resumes and cover letters. These agents can work together to automate and optimize the entire job application process.

Use the latest Microsoft technology to bring your idea to life and create a cohesive system that helps students achieve more.

### 🛠️ **The Application That is Built**

Use Semantic Kernel or other frameworks to develop your own multi-agent applications using Microsoft's latest GenAI technology. Build a web application, present it with a frontend and backend and use the Azure Cloud to host your application.
